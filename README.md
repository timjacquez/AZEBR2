# AZEBR2
App for AZ Exotic Bird Rescue

This app is the first version of the AZEBR app. (Note about it being AZEBR2, I made a rookie mistake having android.example in the domain,
so I had to remake the project and copy/paste the files). 

It's an app to help the AZ Exotic Bird Rescue by providing a means to keep patrons engaged in the business and give new patrons information on birds that are for adoption. The end goal is to have a real-time database of birds currently available for adoption, as well as the basic information about the birds. This will help the rescue rehome birds faster, and reduce the workload of the staff.
